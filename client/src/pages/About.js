            To spread love. <br /> It&#39;s simple, but powerful. Through
            worship, service, fellowship, and outreach, we aim to reflect
            God&#39;s love in all aspects of our lives. Whether it&#39;s lending
            a helping hand, offering a listening ear, or creating space for
            spiritual growth, our church family is here to love and be loved.{" "}
            <br />
            Serving our community is a core part of who we are. We partner with
            local shelters, schools, and food banks to provide meals, clothing,
            and essential support to those in need. We organize neighborhood
            clean-up days, host free community events, and offer resources for
            families facing hardship. We believe that when we uplift our
            neighbors, we reflect the heart of Christâ€”and together, we build a
            stronger, more compassionate community.
